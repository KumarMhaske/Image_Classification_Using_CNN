#Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This repository contains a project focused on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal of this project is to classify images of flowers (roses and tulips) using TensorFlow and Keras.

Project Overview
The dataset used for this project is the "flower_photos" dataset, which contains images of different types of flowers. The project demonstrates how to preprocess image data, build and train a CNN model for image classification, and evaluate the model's performance using validation data.

Key Features
Image Preprocessing: Resize and normalize images to be used in the CNN.
Data Augmentation: Improve the model's generalization by applying augmentation techniques.
Model Training: Train a CNN using Keras.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance on a validation set.

TensorFlow (for building and training the CNN model)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
Matplotlib (for visualizing images and results)
PIL (for image loading and manipulation)
Pandas (for data management)

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains images of flowers (roses and tulips). It is downloaded and extracted directly from TensorFlow’s example storage.

Results
You can evaluate the model’s performance after training by checking the accuracy on the validation dataset.
